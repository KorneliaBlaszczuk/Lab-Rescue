# Lab Rescue – Social Media Content Portfolio

This repository showcases social media content I have created as a volunteer content creator for [Lab Rescue – Adopcje Zwierząt Laboratoryjnych](https://labrescue.pl/), the foundation in Poland dedicated to rescuing and rehoming laboratory animals.

## 🐾 About Lab Rescue

Lab Rescue is a nonprofit organization that collaborates with laboratories across Poland to find homes for animals after scientific experiments. Many of these animals are healthy and suitable for adoption but would otherwise face euthanasia due to lack of options. Since its inception, Lab Rescue has saved over 6,000 animals, including rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, mice, and gerbils.

## 🎯 My Role

As a volunteer content creator, I was responsible for producing engaging digital content to support Lab Rescue’s mission, including:

- Designing eye-catching graphics and posts for Instagram and Facebook
- Writing compelling captions that tell the stories of rescue animals and promote adoption campaigns
- Creating educational content about animal care and rescue
- Developing fundraising and awareness campaign materials
- Monitoring post engagement and adapting content strategies accordingly

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a separate post and contains:

- `post.jpg` or `reel.mp4` — Final graphic or video
- `caption.txt` — Text used in the social media post

## 🎯 Goals

This portfolio demonstrates my skills in:

- Visual storytelling and graphic design tailored to nonprofit social media
- Crafting empathetic messages to inspire adoption and support
- Managing content with clear goals and measurable impact
